# EEG-school-project
we have been doing an EEG(Electroencephalogram) to be able to run researches in the long term
in this project we changed the project of cah6 https://www.instructables.com/DIY-EEG-and-ECG-Circuit/ to suit ourselves. you can take a look at it is a great docs to people who are trying to do such a thing 

in first days we researched about EEG's and the way they work after a while we ordered the components. Instead of AD620 in the main project we used INA826 so we needed to change the pcb design and we serial connected some resistors since we couldnt find them
